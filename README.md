# Lesshand

Lesshand is a shorthand for the 21st century. You can speed up your writing and
typing by about 5% by learning just 10 of its abbreviations.[^speed]

Unlike other shorthand systems, Lesshand is *lossless*. This means that you can
type quickly in Lesshand and have a computer program *decode* your shorthand
to standard written English. This makes Lesshand suitable for composing emails,
documents, messages, and more.

It's easy to learn Lesshand. In fact, you already know a lot of it! Lesshand
uses familiar abbreviations like "u" for "you", "v" for "very", and "bc" for
"because". All of its abbreviations are designed to be mnemonic. It's also
completely incremental; you can learn just a few abbreviations and start
applying them right away.
