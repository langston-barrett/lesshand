# Comparison to other shorthands

The principal difference between Lesshand and other shorthands is that Lesshand
is *lossless*. This means that you can type quickly in Lesshand and have a
computer program *decode* your shorthand to standard written English, making
Lesshand suitable for composing emails, documents, messages, and more.

Another key differentiator is that Lesshand is *alphabetic*, meaning it doesn't
use any symbols outside of what you'd normally find on a keyboard.

Lesshand also emphasizes memorability and ease of learning.

The following is a comparison between Lesshand and a few typeable shorthands. As
you can see, Lesshand is considerably more verbose, but also considerably easier
to read. Furthermore, the sample text pleasantly justifies the losslessness
of Lesshand. There would be *no point* in writing this letter in these other
shorthands: the recipient couldn't read it!
