## Nouns  <!-- def: noun -->

In English, nouns may be inflected for number (adding "s" or "es" to mark
plurality) or the genitive case (adding "'s" or "s'" to show possession). In
Lesshand, these inflections are are marked by adding "s", "'" (apostrophe), or
"s'" ("s" then apostrophe) to the end of a noun abbreviation respectively. Not
all nouns have each form: we don't say "everythings".

Lesshand abbreviates the following common nouns and their inflections:

```
address --> addr

apartments --> aptms

```

## Adjectives  <!-- def: adjective -->

Adjectives may be inflected to indicate a degree of comparison (by adding "er",
or "est" to the end), or to use them as adverbs ("ly"). In Lesshand, these
inflections are marked by adding the same suffix to the abbreviation of the
root word (e.g., "intl" becomes "intlly").

Lesshand abbreviates the following common adjectives:


```
good --> gd
international --> intl
internationally --> intlly
little --> lil
littlest --> lilst
major --> mjr
minor --> mnr
```

## Verbs  <!-- def: verb -->

There are generally five forms of verbs in English:

1. The infinitive/dictionary/lemma/"to" form, e.g. "run"
2. "-ing" form, i.e., present participle or gerund, e.g., "they were running"
3. "-ed" form, i.e., simple past or preterite, e.g., "they ran" or "we watched"
4. A different "-ed" form called the *participle*, only different from preterite
   for irregular verbs, i.e., following "was" or "were", e.g., "chosen"
5. An "-s" form, i.e., third person singular present, e.g., "he runs"

For verbs that have an abbreviation of their infinitive, the abbreviation of
the present participle can be formed by adding "q" to the end. Lesshand does not
currently provide abbreviations for the other conjugations.

<!--
Similarly, the abbreviation of the simple past form can be formed by suffixing
"x", and the third person singular present by "z".
-->

Lesshand abbreviates the following common verbs:

```
have --> hv
having --> hvq
keeping --> kpq
keep --> kp
knowing --> kwq
knowingly --> kwqly
know --> kw
minimize --> minz
minimizing --> minzq
maximize --> maxz
maximizing --> maxzq
```

## Phrases  <!-- def: phrase -->

Lesshand reuses the following abbreviations for phrases that are already common
in English. They are prefixed by "," to disambiguate them with actual uses of
that abbreviation.

```
as far as I know --> ,afaik
be right back --> ,brb
for real --> ,fr
for your information --> ,fyi
I don't care --> ,idc
I don't know --> ,idk
if I remember correctly --> ,iirc
if I understand correctly --> ,iiuc
I love you --> ,ily
I love you so much --> ,ilysm
in case you missed it --> ,icymi
in my honest opinion --> ,imho
in my opinion --> ,imo
just kidding --> ,jk
looks good to me --> ,lgtm
no problem --> ,np
of course --> ,ofc
on my way --> ,omw
right now --> ,rn
talk to you later --> ,ttyl
talk to you soon --> ,ttys
thank you so much --> ,tysm
thank you --> ,ty
to be honest --> ,tbh
with respect to --> ,wrt
you're welcome --> ,yw
```

## Contractions  <!-- def: contractions -->

<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_English_contractions -->

In addition to the contractions listed above, the following are also
abbreviated (even though their lemma is not):
```
ain't --> ai'
didn't --> di'
don't --> do'
hadn't --> had'
hasn't --> has'
mustn't --> must'
needn't --> need'
oughtn't --> ought'
```

## Days  <!-- def: days -->

The days of the week each have a four-letter abbreviation:

```
Sunday --> sund
Sundays --> sunds
Sunday's --> sund'
Sundays' --> sunds'
Monday --> mond
Mondays --> monds
Monday's --> mond'
Mondays' --> monds'
Tuesday --> tues
Tuesdays --> tuess
Tuesday's --> tues'
Tuesdays' --> tuess'
Wednesday --> weds
Wednesdays --> wedss
Wednesday's --> weds'
Wednesdays' --> wedss'
Thursday --> thur
Thursdays --> thurs
Thursday's --> thur'
Thursdays' --> thurs'
Friday --> frid
Fridays --> frids
Friday's --> frid'
Fridays' --> frids'
Saturday --> satd
Saturdays --> satds
Saturday's --> satd'
Saturdays' --> satds'
```

Unfortunately, the standard three-letter abbreviations collide with actual words
("sun", "wed", "sat").

```

```
zero --> n0
one --> n1
two --> n2
three --> n3
four --> n4
five --> n5
six --> n6
seven --> n7
eight --> n8
nine --> n9
ten --> n10

thirteen --> n13
fourteen --> n14
fifteen --> n15
sixteen --> n16
seventeen --> n17
eighteen --> n18
nineteen --> n19
twenty --> n20
```

And similarly for the first many ordinals:

```

third --> o3
fourth --> o4
fifth --> o5
sixth --> o6
seventh --> o7
eighth --> o8
ninth --> o9

```

## Cities  <!-- def: cities -->

The following city names are abbreviated. They are prefixed by "," to
