## Abbreviations

Lesshand has *abbreviations* for common words. You probably already know a lot
of them! For example, "you" is written as "u", "because" is "bc", and "people"
is "ppl".

Here are ten familiar abbreviations for common words to get you started:
```
are --> r
because --> bc
no --> n
really --> rly
though --> tho
tomorrow --> tmrw
very --> v
yes --> y
you --> u
your --> ur
```

Using these abbreviations, the sentence

> You are really going to enjoy your day tomorrow, it'll be very special.

would be written

> u r rly going to enjoy ur day tmrw, it'll be v special.

That's 22% shorter!

### A note on "the"

Almost all of Lesshand's abbreviations are *mnemonic*, meaning they are designed
to be easy to remember. They are usually either existing abbreviations (like
"u" for "you") or they are formed from letters that appear in the abbreviated
word (like "abt" for "about"). The only exception is the abbreviation for
"the".

"The" is the most common word in English, so it's essential that it has a
one-letter abbreviation. However, several other common words start with "t",
such as "to" and "that". Additionally, "the" should be as easy as possible to
type, so it needs an abbreviation that's on the "home row" of standard QWERTY
keyboards.

With these considerations in mind, "the" is abbreviated as "l". This may seem
counterintuitive, but it won't be too hard to remember since you'll use it all
the time. Additionally, it's very effective: just using this single abbreviation
can save you about 1% of your time while writing!

### The most effective abbreviations

Here are the ten abbreviations that will save you the most time:
```
the --> l
and --> d
of --> o
to --> t
for --> f
that --> tt
was --> w
from --> m
are --> r
is --> s
```
These will speed up your writing and typing by about 5%.

When you've mastered those, here are a few more:
```
could --> cd
should --> sd
would --> wd
this --> h
have --> hv
not --> x
about --> abt
between --> bw
without --> wo
I --> i
```

See [Abbreviations](abbrevs.md) for the full list.

### Phrases

Lesshand reuses abbreviations for phrases are already common in English. These
are prefixed by "," to disambiguate them with actual uses of that abbreviation.
For example, "thank you" becomes ",ty" and "I don't care" becomes ",idc".

## Suffixes

The suffix "ing" can be replaced by "q". For example, "learning" may be
abbreviated "learnq". Similarly, the suffix "tion" may be replaced by "T",
turning "celebration" into "celebraT". See [Suffixes](suffixes.md) for more
information.

## Namespaces

For less common words, Lesshand provides *namespaces* of abbreviations.
For example, the namespace "c" is for names of countries. "Sweden" can be
abbreviated "c,se" and "United Kingdom" as "c,gb". The "b" namespace is
for basketball terms. "b,den" stands for "Denver Nuggets". See
[Namespaces](namespaces.md) for more information.
