# Extensions

You can customize Lesshand by adding your own abbreviations. Extensions are
supported by the [command-line interface](cli.md).

These extensions may conflict with one another, and generally are not expected
to fulfill all of the [requirements](reqs.md) of normal Lesshand abbreviations.

Some ideas for extensions are below.
