# Good abbreviations

To evaluate the quality of Lesshand's abbreviations, we have developed three
different numeric scores. Each score attempts to approximate some important
quality of an abbreviation.

- *Effort* approximates how much time and energy an abbreviation saves. Good
  abbreviations save lots of effort.
- *Memorability* approximates how easy it is to learn and remember an
  abbreviation. Good abbreviations are highly memorable.
- *Ambiguity* approximates how ambiguous a given abbreviation is. Good
  abbreviations have low ambiguity, i.e., are unambiguous.

For each score, there is some threshold that abbreviations must pass to be
included in Lesshand. These thresholds are fundamentally arbitrary, but each
seems to include enough abbreviations to be useful while excluding a decent
number of undesirable abbreviations.
